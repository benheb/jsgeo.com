The code for the website, to be hosted at jsgeo.com 

##Starting the server 

This repo just contains assets like css and js and jade templates. 
To serve these assets I started using [http://harpjs.com](harpjs) which makes it easy to run a static site: 

    # first install harp
    sudo npm install harp -g 

    # now start the server
    cd jsgeo.com && harp server 

That's it, pretty simple to hack on and have fun.
